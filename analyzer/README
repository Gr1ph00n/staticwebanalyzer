Before you start:

This project is written in Python 2.7.x, you need to have it installed
You need Mechanize package, available here: http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/

We'are trying to create a PoC, so stay tuned for next updates...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Base conventions:

1) this is a crossplatform tool, so be free to use your favorite OS :) [plz keep in mind the
  differences between 'nix and win]
2) you can use your favorite programming style, but you should make things clear and working,
  moreover you must not commit anything not working or not properly tested
3) you have to add the file header described in the end of this document to your own files,
  keep them updated each time you edit a file, so we will know the first mate to blame when 
  something does not work :D, moreover each time you will edit something in a file, you should
  add a comment explaining what you changed "#~", what you added "#+" or deleted "#-".
  In project main dir, there is a changelog file that must be updated each time you are gonna 
  commit something...
4) Don't forget to add minimal description of what your method does ;)
